# 21_SECURITY_AUDIT.md

## Overview

This document outlines how to conduct security audits for the neural network system using containerized tools. It includes tools, methodologies, and best practices for identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities to ensure the system's integrity and protection against threats.

## Importance of Security Audits

### Description

Security audits are essential for ensuring that the neural network system is protected against threats and vulnerabilities. Regular audits help identify potential security issues before they can be exploited, thereby maintaining the system's integrity and protecting sensitive data.

## Tools for Security Audits

### Description

Various tools can be used to conduct security audits. These tools help automate the process of identifying vulnerabilities and assessing the security posture of the system.

### Examples of Tools

1. **Nmap**: A network scanning tool that identifies open ports and services.
2. **OWASP ZAP**: An open-source web application security scanner.
3. **Nikto**: A web server scanner that tests for various vulnerabilities.
4. **Lynis**: A security auditing tool for Unix-based systems.

### Containerizing Security Tools

Each of these tools can be containerized to ensure consistency and ease of use.

#### Example: Nmap Dockerfile

```dockerfile
# Use the official Docker image for Nmap
FROM instrumentisto/nmap

ENTRYPOINT ["nmap"]
CMD ["--help"]
```

Build and run the Nmap container:

```sh
docker build -t nmap-container .
docker run --rm nmap-container -sV -p 1-65535 localhost
```

#### Example: OWASP ZAP Docker Compose Configuration

Add the following service to your `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  zap:
    image: owasp/zap2docker-stable
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    command: zap.sh -daemon -port 8080 -host 0.0.0.0
```

Run the OWASP ZAP container:

```sh
docker-compose up -d zap
```

#### Example: Nikto Dockerfile

```dockerfile
# Use the official Docker image for Nikto
FROM sneppets/nikto

ENTRYPOINT ["nikto"]
CMD ["--help"]
```

Build and run the Nikto container:

```sh
docker build -t nikto-container .
docker run --rm nikto-container -h http://localhost
```

#### Example: Lynis Docker Compose Configuration

Add the following service to your `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  lynis:
    image: cisofy/lynis
    volumes:
      - /:/hostroot:ro
    entrypoint: ["lynis", "audit", "system"]
```

Run the Lynis container:

```sh
docker-compose run --rm lynis
```

## Methodologies for Security Audits

### Description

Security audits should follow a structured methodology to ensure comprehensive coverage of potential vulnerabilities. This includes planning, execution, and reporting phases.

### Steps

1. **Planning**: Define the scope and objectives of the audit, identify critical assets, and select appropriate tools.
2. **Execution**: Conduct the audit using the selected tools and techniques to identify vulnerabilities.
3. **Reporting**: Document the findings, assess the risk levels, and provide recommendations for mitigation.

### Example: Execution Phase

1. **Network Scanning**: Use Nmap to scan the network and identify open ports and services.
   ```sh
   docker run --rm nmap-container -sV -p 1-65535 localhost
   ```

2. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Use OWASP ZAP to scan web applications for common vulnerabilities.
   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d zap
   ```

3. **System Auditing**: Use Lynis to perform a comprehensive security audit of the system.
   ```sh
   docker-compose run --rm lynis
   ```

## Best Practices for Security Audits

### Description

Following best practices for security audits ensures that the process is effective and thorough, providing valuable insights into the system's security posture.

### Guidelines

1. **Regular Audits**: Conduct security audits regularly to identify and mitigate new vulnerabilities.
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Ensure that the audit covers all aspects of the system, including network, applications, and configurations.
3. **Risk Assessment**: Assess the risk levels of identified vulnerabilities and prioritize remediation efforts based on the potential impact.
4. **Documentation**: Maintain detailed documentation of the audit process, findings, and mitigation efforts.

### Example: Regular Audits

Schedule regular security audits and integrate them into the development lifecycle to ensure continuous monitoring and improvement of the system's security.

```sh
# Example cron job to run Lynis audit weekly
0 0 * * 0 docker-compose run --rm lynis > /var/log/lynis_audit.log
```

## Conclusion

Conducting regular security audits is essential for maintaining the security and integrity of the neural network system. By using containerized tools, following a structured methodology, and adhering to best practices, you can effectively identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities, ensuring the system remains protected against potential threats.
