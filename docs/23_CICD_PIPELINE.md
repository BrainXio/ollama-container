# 23_CI_CD_PIPELINE.md

## Overview

This document details the setup and management of a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the neural network system. It covers the use of tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI/CD for automating testing, building, and deployment processes.

## Importance of CI/CD

### Description

CI/CD pipelines automate the process of integrating code changes, running tests, and deploying applications. This ensures that the neural network system remains robust, scalable, and up-to-date, with minimal manual intervention.

### Benefits

1. **Automation**: Automates repetitive tasks such as testing and deployment.
2. **Consistency**: Ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
3. **Early Detection**: Identifies issues early in the development cycle.
4. **Faster Releases**: Enables quicker and more reliable releases.

## Tools for CI/CD

### Description

Various tools can be used to set up CI/CD pipelines. These tools help automate the process of building, testing, and deploying the application.

### Examples of Tools

1. **GitHub Actions**: A CI/CD service integrated with GitHub repositories.
2. **Jenkins**: An open-source automation server that supports building, deploying, and automating projects.
3. **GitLab CI/CD**: A built-in CI/CD tool within GitLab that automates the software development lifecycle.

## Example: GitHub Actions

### Description

GitHub Actions enables the automation of workflows directly within a GitHub repository.

### Configuration

Create a `.github/workflows/ci-cd-pipeline.yml` file to define the CI/CD pipeline.

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.8'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt

    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        pytest

    - name: Build Docker image
      run: |
        docker build -t neural_network_image .

    - name: Push Docker image
      uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
      with:
        context: .
        push: true
        tags: user/neural_network_image:latest

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Deploy to production
      run: |
        docker-compose down
        docker-compose pull
        docker-compose up -d
```

## Example: Jenkins

### Description

Jenkins is an open-source automation server that supports building, deploying, and automating projects.

### Configuration

1. **Install Jenkins**: Follow the installation instructions on the [Jenkins website](https://www.jenkins.io/download/).
2. **Create a Pipeline Job**: Create a new pipeline job in Jenkins.
3. **Pipeline Script**: Use the following Jenkins pipeline script.

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                checkout scm
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker build -t neural_network_image .'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'pytest'
            }
        }
        stage('Push') {
            steps {
                script {
                    docker.withRegistry('https://index.docker.io/v1/', 'dockerhub-credentials') {
                        docker.image('neural_network_image').push('latest')
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh '''
                docker-compose down
                docker-compose pull
                docker-compose up -d
                '''
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Example: GitLab CI/CD

### Description

GitLab CI/CD is a built-in tool within GitLab that automates the software development lifecycle.

### Configuration

Create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to define the CI/CD pipeline.

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - docker build -t neural_network_image .

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - pytest

push:
  stage: build
  script:
    - docker login -u "$CI_REGISTRY_USER" -p "$CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD" "$CI_REGISTRY"
    - docker push $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:latest

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - docker-compose down
    - docker-compose pull
    - docker-compose up -d
  only:
    - main
```

## Best Practices for CI/CD

### Description

Following best practices for CI/CD ensures that the pipelines are efficient, reliable, and maintainable.

### Guidelines

1. **Automated Tests**: Ensure that all code changes are tested automatically.
2. **Incremental Builds**: Use incremental builds to speed up the CI/CD process.
3. **Parallel Jobs**: Run jobs in parallel to reduce the overall build time.
4. **Environment Parity**: Maintain consistency between development, testing, and production environments.
5. **Monitoring**: Monitor the CI/CD pipeline for failures and performance issues.

## Conclusion

Setting up a CI/CD pipeline is essential for automating the development, testing, and deployment processes of the neural network system. By using tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI/CD, and following best practices, you can ensure that the system remains robust, scalable, and up-to-date with minimal manual intervention.
