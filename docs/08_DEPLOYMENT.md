# 8_DEPLOYMENT.md

## Overview

This document describes the deployment process for the neural network in a local environment. It includes setup instructions, environment configurations, and continuous deployment pipelines to ensure a smooth and efficient deployment process. Cloud services can be considered extensions for later stages.

## Deployment Process

### Description

Deploying the neural network locally involves setting up the necessary infrastructure on your local machine, configuring the environment, and implementing continuous deployment pipelines to automate the deployment process. This ensures that the neural network is always up-to-date and running efficiently in a local environment.

### Local Infrastructure Setup

To deploy the neural network locally, you will need:

1. **Docker Installed**: Ensure Docker is installed and running on your local machine.
2. **GPU Support**: If your neural network requires GPU support, ensure your machine has a compatible GPU and the necessary drivers installed.
3. **Python Environment**: Set up a Python environment with all necessary dependencies.

### Environment Configuration

Configure the environment by setting up necessary environment variables, installing dependencies, and preparing the Docker containers.

#### Dockerfile

Ensure your Dockerfile includes all necessary configurations:

```dockerfile
# Use the base image for Ollama
FROM ollama-base:latest

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Install Python and necessary packages
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    python3 python3-pip && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* && \
    apt-get clean && \
    apt-get -y autoremove

# Copy the Python script and requirements file
COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
COPY ollama_base_cell.py custom_ollama_cell.py

# Install Python dependencies
RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Start the Ollama service and then run the custom cell script
CMD ["/bin/bash", "-c", "/usr/local/bin/start-ollama.sh & sleep 5 && python3 custom_ollama_cell.py"]
```

### Docker Compose Setup

Using Docker Compose can simplify the management of multi-container applications. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to define the services.

#### docker-compose.yml

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  neuron1:
    build: .
    container_name: neuron1
    environment:
      - MODEL_NAME=example
    ports:
      - "11434:11434"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/mnt/c/data

  neuron2:
    build: .
    container_name: neuron2
    environment:
      - MODEL_NAME=example
    ports:
      - "11435:11434"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/mnt/c/data
```

### Running the Deployment

1. **Build the Docker Images**:
   ```sh
   docker-compose build
   ```

2. **Start the Containers**:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Check the Status**:
   ```sh
   docker ps
   ```

### Continuous Deployment Pipelines

Implement continuous deployment pipelines to automate the deployment process locally. This ensures that the latest updates are deployed automatically.

#### Example: GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
name: Local Deployment Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.8'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    - name: Build Docker images
      run: docker-compose build
    - name: Run tests
      run: docker-compose run --rm neuron1 python -m unittest discover
    - name: Deploy locally
      run: docker-compose up -d
```

### Monitoring and Logging

Set up monitoring and logging to keep track of the systemâ€™s performance and health.

#### Example: Using Docker Logs

```sh
# View logs for neuron1
docker logs neuron1

# View logs for neuron2
docker logs neuron2
```

### Local Testing

Ensure that the deployment works as expected by running integration tests and verifying the communication between neurons.

#### Example: Integration Test Script

```python
import requests

# Test communication between neurons
response = requests.post('http://localhost:11434/chat', json={"model": "example", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, neuron1"}]})
print("Response from neuron1:", response.json())

response = requests.post('http://localhost:11435/chat', json={"model": "example", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, neuron2"}]})
print("Response from neuron2:", response.json())
```

## Conclusion

Deploying the neural network locally ensures that the system is set up and running efficiently before considering cloud deployments. By following the steps outlined above, you can manage, monitor, and maintain the neural network in a local environment. This setup also allows for easy transition to cloud services when needed, providing flexibility and scalability for future developments.
