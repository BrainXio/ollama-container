# 19_CONTAINERIZATION.md

## Overview

This document provides guidelines for containerizing the neural network system. It covers the benefits of containerization, how to create Docker images and Docker Compose configurations, and best practices for maintaining and optimizing containerized applications.

## Benefits of Containerization

### Description

Containerization involves packaging an application and its dependencies into a container that can run consistently across different environments. This approach offers several benefits:

1. **Consistency**: Containers ensure that the application runs the same way regardless of the environment (development, testing, production).
2. **Portability**: Containers can be easily moved across different environments and cloud providers.
3. **Scalability**: Container orchestration tools like Docker Swarm and Kubernetes facilitate the scaling of applications.
4. **Isolation**: Containers provide isolation, ensuring that applications do not interfere with each other.

## Creating Docker Images

### Description

Docker images are the building blocks of containers. They contain the application code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies needed to run the application.

### Example: Dockerfile for the Neural Network

```dockerfile
# Use the base image for Ollama
FROM ollama-base:latest

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Install Python and necessary packages
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    python3 python3-pip && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* && \
    apt-get clean && \
    apt-get -y autoremove

# Copy the Python script and requirements file
COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
COPY ollama_base_cell.py custom_ollama_cell.py

# Install Python dependencies
RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Start the Ollama service and then run the custom cell script
CMD ["/bin/bash", "-c", "/usr/local/bin/start-ollama.sh & sleep 5 && python3 custom_ollama_cell.py"]
```

### Building the Docker Image

1. **Build the Image**:
   ```sh
   docker build -t neural_network_image .
   ```

2. **Run the Container**:
   ```sh
   docker run -d --name neural_network_container -p 11434:11434 neural_network_image
   ```

## Docker Compose

### Description

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file to configure the application's services, networks, and volumes.

### Example: Docker Compose File

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to define the services for the neural network.

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  neuron1:
    build: .
    container_name: neuron1
    environment:
      - MODEL_NAME=example
    ports:
      - "11434:11434"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/mnt/c/data

  neuron2:
    build: .
    container_name: neuron2
    environment:
      - MODEL_NAME=example
    ports:
      - "11435:11434"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/mnt/c/data

  prometheus:
    image: prom/prometheus:latest
    volumes:
      - ./prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
    ports:
      - "9090:9090"

  grafana:
    image: grafana/grafana:latest
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - grafana-storage:/var/lib/grafana
    environment:
      - GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin

volumes:
  grafana-storage:
```

### Running Docker Compose

1. **Start the Services**:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Stop the Services**:
   ```sh
   docker-compose down
   ```

## Best Practices for Containerization

### Description

Following best practices for containerization ensures that the applications are maintainable, efficient, and secure.

### Guidelines

1. **Keep Images Small**: Use minimal base images and remove unnecessary dependencies to keep the Docker images small.
2. **Use Multi-Stage Builds**: Use multi-stage builds to optimize the build process and reduce the final image size.
3. **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for configuration to make the containers more flexible and easier to manage.
4. **Security**: Regularly update images and use security scanning tools to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
5. **Resource Limits**: Set resource limits to prevent containers from consuming excessive resources and impacting other applications.

### Example: Multi-Stage Build

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build the application
FROM python:3.8-slim as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .

# Stage 2: Create the final image
FROM python:3.8-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app /app
CMD ["python", "custom_ollama_cell.py"]
```

## Conclusion

Containerization provides significant benefits for developing, deploying, and maintaining the neural network system. By creating Docker images, using Docker Compose, and following best practices, you can ensure that the system is portable, scalable, and secure. This approach facilitates consistent environments, efficient resource usage, and easy management of the application's lifecycle.
