# 25_API_DESIGN.md

## Overview

This document provides guidelines for designing and documenting APIs for the neural network system. It includes best practices for RESTful API design, versioning, and generating API documentation to ensure the APIs are robust, easy to use, and well-documented.

## Importance of API Design

### Description

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are critical for enabling communication between different parts of the system and with external systems. Good API design ensures that the APIs are intuitive, maintainable, and scalable.

## Best Practices for RESTful API Design

### Description

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style that uses standard HTTP methods and status codes. Following REST principles makes APIs more predictable and easier to use.

### Guidelines

1. **Use Nouns for Endpoints**: Endpoints should represent resources and be named using nouns.
2. **Use Standard HTTP Methods**: Use GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH for operations.
3. **Statelessness**: Each request should contain all necessary information for the server to process it.
4. **Use HTTP Status Codes**: Return appropriate status codes for different outcomes (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for not found, 500 for server error).
5. **Versioning**: Use versioning to manage changes and ensure backward compatibility.

### Example: RESTful API Endpoints

```yaml
GET /api/v1/neuralnetworks        # Retrieve a list of neural networks
GET /api/v1/neuralnetworks/{id}   # Retrieve a specific neural network
POST /api/v1/neuralnetworks       # Create a new neural network
PUT /api/v1/neuralnetworks/{id}   # Update a specific neural network
DELETE /api/v1/neuralnetworks/{id} # Delete a specific neural network
```

### Example: Using HTTP Status Codes

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "example_neural_network"
  }
}
```

- **200 OK**: The request was successful.
- **201 Created**: The resource was successfully created.
- **400 Bad Request**: The request was invalid or cannot be processed.
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource was not found.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: An error occurred on the server.

## Versioning APIs

### Description

Versioning APIs is crucial to manage changes and ensure backward compatibility. It allows clients to continue using older versions while new versions are introduced.

### Strategies

1. **URI Versioning**: Include the version number in the URL.
2. **Header Versioning**: Include the version number in the HTTP headers.
3. **Query Parameter Versioning**: Include the version number as a query parameter.

### Example: URI Versioning

```yaml
GET /api/v1/neuralnetworks        # Version 1 of the API
GET /api/v2/neuralnetworks        # Version 2 of the API
```

## Generating API Documentation

### Description

Comprehensive documentation makes it easier for developers to understand and use the API. It should include endpoint descriptions, request and response formats, error codes, and examples.

### Tools for API Documentation

1. **Swagger/OpenAPI**: A framework for API specification and documentation.
2. **Redoc**: A tool for generating API documentation from OpenAPI specifications.
3. **Postman**: A tool for API testing and documentation.

### Example: Swagger/OpenAPI Specification

Create an `openapi.yaml` file to define the API specification.

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: Neural Network API
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  /neuralnetworks:
    get:
      summary: Retrieve a list of neural networks
      responses:
        '200':
          description: A list of neural networks
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  $ref: '#/components/schemas/NeuralNetwork'
  /neuralnetworks/{id}:
    get:
      summary: Retrieve a specific neural network
      parameters:
        - name: id
          in: path
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
      responses:
        '200':
          description: A neural network
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/NeuralNetwork'
components:
  schemas:
    NeuralNetwork:
      type: object
      properties:
        id:
          type: string
        name:
          type: string
```

### Example: Generating Documentation with Redoc

1. **Install Redoc**: Follow the installation instructions on the [Redoc website](https://redoc.ly/).
2. **Generate Documentation**: Use Redoc CLI to generate static HTML documentation from the OpenAPI specification.

```sh
npx redoc-cli bundle openapi.yaml
```

### Example: Postman Collection

1. **Create a Collection**: In Postman, create a new collection and define the API requests.
2. **Export the Collection**: Export the collection as a JSON file.
3. **Generate Documentation**: Use Postman's built-in documentation features to generate and publish API documentation.

## Conclusion

Designing and documenting APIs effectively ensures that they are easy to use, maintain, and extend. By following best practices for RESTful API design, versioning APIs appropriately, and generating comprehensive documentation, you can create APIs that are robust, scalable, and developer-friendly.
