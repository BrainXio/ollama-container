# 10_TROUBLESHOOTING.md

## Overview

This document provides troubleshooting steps for common issues that might arise during the development, testing, or deployment of the neural network. It includes diagnostic commands, log file locations, and potential fixes to ensure smooth operations.

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Description

During the development and deployment of the neural network, various issues may arise. This guide provides a systematic approach to identify, diagnose, and resolve common problems, ensuring minimal downtime and maintaining system performance.

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Docker Container Issues

**Issue:** Docker containers fail to start.

**Symptoms:**
- Containers exit immediately after starting.
- Error messages in Docker logs.

**Diagnostic Commands:**
```sh
# Check container status
docker ps -a

# View container logs
docker logs <container_name>
```

**Potential Fixes:**
- Ensure the Docker daemon is running.
- Check for errors in the container logs and address them accordingly.
- Verify that all necessary environment variables are set correctly in the Dockerfile or `docker-compose.yml`.
- Increase the logging level for more detailed output.

#### 2. Network Connectivity Issues

**Issue:** Neurons cannot communicate with each other.

**Symptoms:**
- No response from connected neurons.
- Network-related error messages.

**Diagnostic Commands:**
```sh
# Check network configuration
docker network ls
docker network inspect <network_name>

# Test connectivity between containers
docker exec <container_name> ping <other_container_name>
```

**Potential Fixes:**
- Ensure all containers are connected to the same Docker network.
- Verify that the correct ports are exposed and mapped in the `docker-compose.yml`.
- Use Dockerâ€™s built-in DNS service to refer to other containers by name.

#### 3. Prometheus/Grafana Setup Issues

**Issue:** Prometheus or Grafana fails to start or does not collect/display metrics.

**Symptoms:**
- Prometheus/Grafana containers fail to start.
- No metrics visible in Grafana dashboards.

**Diagnostic Commands:**
```sh
# Check Prometheus logs
docker logs <prometheus_container_name>

# Check Grafana logs
docker logs <grafana_container_name>

# Verify Prometheus targets
curl http://localhost:9090/targets
```

**Potential Fixes:**
- Ensure the Prometheus configuration file (`prometheus.yml`) is correctly mounted.
- Verify that Grafana is configured with the correct Prometheus data source URL.
- Check for firewall rules or network issues preventing communication between Prometheus and monitored services.

#### 4. High Resource Utilization

**Issue:** High CPU or memory usage affecting performance.

**Symptoms:**
- Slow response times.
- High CPU or memory usage observed in monitoring tools.

**Diagnostic Commands:**
```sh
# Check Docker stats
docker stats

# View system resource usage
top
htop
```

**Potential Fixes:**
- Optimize the neural network code for efficiency.
- Adjust Docker resource limits (CPU, memory) in the `docker-compose.yml`.
- Scale the system horizontally by adding more instances of resource-intensive services.

#### 5. Model Loading Issues

**Issue:** Models fail to load or initialize correctly.

**Symptoms:**
- Error messages related to model loading.
- Incomplete model initialization.

**Diagnostic Commands:**
```sh
# Check logs for model loading errors
docker logs <container_name>
```

**Potential Fixes:**
- Ensure the model files are correctly specified and accessible within the container.
- Verify compatibility between the model files and the runtime environment.
- Check for sufficient memory allocation for loading large models.

## Log File Locations

- **Docker Logs:** Use `docker logs <container_name>` to view logs for specific containers.
- **Prometheus Logs:** Logs are available within the Prometheus container.
- **Grafana Logs:** Logs are available within the Grafana container.
- **Application Logs:** Ensure application logs are directed to a persistent storage volume for long-term analysis.

## Diagnostic Commands

### General Docker Commands

```sh
# List all containers
docker ps -a

# View logs for a specific container
docker logs <container_name>

# View real-time stats for containers
docker stats
```

### Network Diagnostics

```sh
# Inspect Docker network
docker network inspect <network_name>

# Test connectivity between containers
docker exec <container_name> ping <other_container_name>
```

### Prometheus/Grafana Diagnostics

```sh
# Verify Prometheus targets
curl http://localhost:9090/targets

# View Prometheus metrics
curl http://localhost:9090/metrics
```

## Conclusion

By following this troubleshooting guide, you can systematically diagnose and resolve common issues that may arise during the development, testing, or deployment of the neural network. This ensures smooth operations and maintains system performance, minimizing downtime and maximizing efficiency.
