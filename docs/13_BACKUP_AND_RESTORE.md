# 13_BACKUP_RESTORE.md

## Overview

This document provides procedures for backing up and restoring the neural network's data and state. It includes instructions for automated backups, disaster recovery planning, and restoring from backups to ensure data integrity and availability.

## Backup and Restore Procedures

### Description

Regular backups are essential for protecting data and ensuring quick recovery in case of data loss or corruption. This section outlines strategies and steps for backing up and restoring the neural network's data and state.

### Automated Backups

Automating the backup process ensures that data is regularly saved without manual intervention.

#### Step 1: Schedule Regular Backups

Use `cron` jobs to schedule regular backups of data and configurations.

##### Example: Cron Job for Backing Up Data

1. **Create a Backup Script**: Write a script to back up the necessary files and databases.

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Define backup directories
BACKUP_DIR=/mnt/c/backup
DATA_DIR=/mnt/c/data
TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%F")

# Create a backup directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p $BACKUP_DIR

# Backup the data directory
tar -czvf $BACKUP_DIR/data_backup_$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz $DATA_DIR

# Backup Docker volumes
docker run --rm --volumes-from neuron1 -v $BACKUP_DIR:/backup busybox tar cvfz /backup/neuron1_backup_$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz /mnt/c/data
docker run --rm --volumes-from neuron2 -v $BACKUP_DIR:/backup busybox tar cvfz /backup/neuron2_backup_$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz /mnt/c/data
```

2. **Schedule the Script with Cron**: Add a cron job to run the backup script daily.

```sh
crontab -e

# Add the following line to schedule the backup script at 2 AM every day
0 2 * * * /path/to/backup_script.sh
```

### Disaster Recovery Planning

Disaster recovery planning ensures that the system can be quickly restored to operational status after a major failure.

#### Step 1: Identify Critical Components

Identify and document the critical components of the neural network that need to be backed up and restored.

- Model files
- Configuration files
- Data directories
- Docker volumes

#### Step 2: Create a Disaster Recovery Plan

Document the steps required to restore the system in case of a failure.

##### Example: Disaster Recovery Plan

1. **Stop All Running Containers**: Ensure all running containers are stopped.

```sh
docker-compose down
```

2. **Restore Docker Volumes**: Restore the Docker volumes from the backup files.

```sh
docker run --rm -v /mnt/c/backup:/backup -v neuron1:/mnt/c/data busybox tar xvf /backup/neuron1_backup_$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz -C /
docker run --rm -v /mnt/c/backup:/backup -v neuron2:/mnt/c/data busybox tar xvf /backup/neuron2_backup_$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz -C /
```

3. **Start the Containers**: Start the Docker containers with the restored data.

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

### Restoring from Backups

Restoring from backups involves retrieving the saved data and configurations to bring the system back to its previous state.

#### Step 1: Locate the Backup Files

Identify the most recent backup files that need to be restored.

#### Step 2: Restore the Data

Use the backup files to restore the data and configurations.

##### Example: Restoring Data from a Backup

1. **Stop the Containers**:

```sh
docker-compose down
```

2. **Restore Data Directories**:

```sh
tar -xzvf /mnt/c/backup/data_backup_$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz -C /mnt/c/data
```

3. **Restore Docker Volumes**:

```sh
docker run --rm -v /mnt/c/backup:/backup -v neuron1:/mnt/c/data busybox tar xvf /backup/neuron1_backup_$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz -C /
docker run --rm -v /mnt/c/backup:/backup -v neuron2:/mnt/c/data busybox tar xvf /backup/neuron2_backup_$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz -C /
```

4. **Start the Containers**:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

## Best Practices

### Regularly Test Backups

Regularly test the backup and restore procedures to ensure that they work correctly and data integrity is maintained.

### Secure Backup Storage

Ensure that backup files are stored securely and access is restricted to authorized personnel only.

### Version Control

Maintain version control of configuration files and scripts to track changes and ensure consistency across backups and restores.

## Conclusion

Implementing regular backups and having a robust disaster recovery plan are essential for maintaining data integrity and ensuring quick recovery in case of data loss or corruption. By following the procedures outlined in this document, you can protect the neural network's data and maintain system availability.
